## Data

My analysis uses two primary sources of data, both of which are publicly available online. The first of which is Capital Bikeshare’s trip data, from which I pulled all available observations between 2020 and 2023 (totalling more than 8 million rows). These datasets contain information about every trip people took with Capital Bikeshare’s rental bikes—including where they started the trip, where they concluded the trip, the time when the trip started, the time when the trip ended, etc. 

The second source of data I enlist is the Capital Bikeshare locations data, which is available on Open Data DC. It contains information on all 767 bike stations across the DMV region, such as static fields like station capacity and coordinates, as well as more dynamic data like the number of docks available vs. the number of bikes available at each station at a given moment. 

This repo DOES NOT include raw data, but it does include all master data generated from "build" codes.

Raw data can be retrieved from the sources linked above.
